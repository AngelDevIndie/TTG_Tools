This tool have to make easier translations for games from Telltale.
It supports some games (at least I tested only these games):
Telltale Texas Hold'em
Bone: Out from Boneville
Bone: The Great Cow Race
Sam & Max Save the World
Sam & Max Beyond Time and Space
Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People
Wallace & Gromit's Grand Adventures	
Tales of Monkey Island
Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse
Hector: Badge of Carnage
Nelson Tethers: Puzzle Agent
Poker Night at the Inventory
Back to the Future: The Game
Puzzle Agent 2
Jurassic Park: The Game
Law & Order: Legacies
The Walking Dead: Season One
Poker Night 2
The Wolf Among Us
The Walking Dead: Season Two
Tales from the Borderlands
Game of Thrones
Minecraft: Story Mode
The Walking Dead: Michonne
Batman: The Telltale Series (Not complete)
The Walking Dead: A New Frontier (Not complete too)

I'm not sure for support another platform because I don't have it and I don't want to research Telltale's games anymore.
But if you can code and you want translate Telltale's games then use this source code for making own tool.
